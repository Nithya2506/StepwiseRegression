# Stepwise Regression Analysis
The wine-quality-red.csv dataset was used to perform stepwise regression analysis to identify the optimum model for predicting quality of wine based on various features.Â 

The OLS regression model from the statsmodels module in Python was used to perform adjusted R-square selection. 
The adjusted R-square of the model was **34.9%**. 

The stepwise regression analysis on the same dataset was done using **SAS** and the results were same as the above. 
The adjusted R-square of the model was **34.4%**.
